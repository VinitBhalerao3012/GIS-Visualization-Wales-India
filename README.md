# GIS Mapping Project: Wales National Parks & COVID-19 Case Rates in India

This project involves the design and analysis of two GIS-based maps to support educational and public health applications.

## 🗺️ Part 1: National Parks of Wales (General Purpose Map)
Designed a clear and informative map showing the locations of national parks in Wales. Key cartographic elements included:
- Contrasting color schemes to highlight parks
- Transportation networks for accessibility
- Town and region labels for geographic context
- Photos and directional symbols to aid user engagement

### Objective:
Provide a resource for travelers, students, and geography enthusiasts to explore Wales’ natural landscapes.

## 🧪 Part 2: COVID-19 Case Rates in India (Statistical Map)
Created a statistical map comparing population distribution with COVID-19 case rates per 100,000 people across Indian states.

### Features:
- Dual-map layout: Population vs. Case Rates
- Gradient color schemes for clarity
- Data normalized to show relative infection rates
- Supports public health analysis and resource planning

## 📊 Data Sources:
- COVID-19 data from Ministry of Health and WHO
- Population data from Census of India
- National parks and boundaries data from Natural Resources Wales and Ordnance Survey
- Background imagery from OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- QGIS
- Cartographic design principles
- Open data sources

## 📌 Key Learning:
- Effective use of GIS for thematic and general-purpose mapping
- Applying visual design for geographic storytelling
- Data normalization and symbolization for comparative analysis
